# Cryptography Project

Simple implementations of the Caesar and Vigenere ciphers, as well as a command-line interface to call them with. 

## Running

First run ```make``` to compile, then can run via the command-line to call cli(), such as ```crypto.c caesar-encrypt 5 HELLO```. 

Always call like ```crypto.c [method] [key] [message]```. Has the methods of caesar-encrypt, caesar-decrypt, vigenere-encrypt and vigenere-decrypt.
